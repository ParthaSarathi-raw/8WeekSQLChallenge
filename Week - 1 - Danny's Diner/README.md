# Case Study - 1 : Danny's Diner

All the data and questions that I've answered in this page can be found at  [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

And all my solutions have been executed at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138) using POSTGRE SQL V 13. If you get any kind of errors when you are executing my queries given below, you might be using some other dialect of SQL other than postgre sql v 13. Please look up alternate ways to achieve the same thing on your SQL dialect. However I do prefer just practising these questions on DB Fiddle.

## Creating of CTE
We will be using this CTE table as the base table to answer all the questions.

```` sql
WITH CTE as (
SELECT s.*,m.join_date,men.product_name,men.price
FROM dannys_diner.sales s 
FULL OUTER JOIN dannys_diner.members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
FULL OUTER JOIN dannys_diner.menu men ON s.product_id = men.product_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id,order_date)
SELECT * FROM cte;
````

## Solutions

**1) What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```` sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(price) AS total_amount
FROM 
    cte
GROUP BY 
    customer_id
ORDER BY 
    customer_id;
````
#### Output Table

    
| customer_id | total_amount |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 76           |
| B           | 74           |
| C           | 36           |

**2) How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
### Approach 1 : Using Distinct Keyword
```` sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)
FROM 
    CTE
GROUP BY 
    customer_id;
````


### Approach 2 : Without Distinct Keyword
```` sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id,
           order_date 
    FROM cte 
    GROUP BY customer_id, 
             order_date
) temp
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
````
#### Output Table


| customer_id | count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| A           | 4     |
| B           | 6     |

FROM (
    SELECT customer_id,
           product_name,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS dn
    FROM CTE
) temp
WHERE dn = 1;
````
### Approach 2 : Using Joins
```` sql
SELECT cte.customer_id,
       product_name AS first_item_ordered
FROM cte
JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id,
           MIN(order_date) AS min_date
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY customer_id
) temp ON cte.customer_id = temp.customer_id
      AND cte.order_date = temp.min_date
GROUP BY 1, 2;
````
#### Output Table


| customer_id | first_item_purchased |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| A           | curry                |
| A           | sushi                |

       product_name
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id,
           product_name as most_popular_item,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (
               PARTITION BY customer_id
               ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
           ) AS dn
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY 1, 2

       SUM(
           CASE
