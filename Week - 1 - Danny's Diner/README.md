# Case Study - 1 : Danny's Diner

All the data and questions that I've answered in this page can be found at  [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)

And all my solutions have been executed at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138) using POSTGRE SQL V 13. If you get any kind of errors when you are executing my queries given below, you might be using some other dialect of SQL other than postgre sql v 13. Please look up alternate ways to achieve the same thing on your SQL dialect. However I do prefer just practising these questions on DB Fiddle.
