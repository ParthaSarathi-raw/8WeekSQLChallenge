# Case Study - 2 : Pizza Runner

All the data and questions that I've answered in this markdown can be found at  [Dannys Website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).

And all my solutions have been executed at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/7VcQKQwsS3CTkGRFG7vu98/65) using POSTGRE SQL V 13. If you get any kind of errors when you are executing my queries given below, you might be using some other dialect of SQL other than postgre sql v 13. Please look up alternate ways to achieve the same thing on your SQL dialect. However I do prefer just practising these questions on DB Fiddle itself.

- There are a lot of tables, so it would be better to combine tables on the fly based on the requirement rather than using a common CTE to answer all the questions.
