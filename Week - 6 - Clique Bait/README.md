# Case Study - 6 : Clique Bait

All the data and questions that I've answered in this markdown can be found at  [Dannys Website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-6/).

And all my solutions have been executed at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jmnwogTsUE8hGqkZv9H7E8/17) using POSTGRE SQL V 13. If you get any kind of errors when you are executing my queries given below, you might be using some other dialect of SQL other than postgre sql v 13. Please look up alternate ways to achieve the same thing on your SQL dialect. However I do prefer just practising these questions on DB Fiddle itself.

**You can directly skip to code block to directly view the solution. However if you are stuck understanding something I suggest you to read my approach on how I tackled the problem**\
**Also please run the code blocks youself on dbfiddle as you can look at the output and follow through my explanations when you are confused**
