# 8-Week SQL Challenge Solutions

In this repository you can find all the dannys 8 Week Sql Challenge solutions which requires to write SQL queries. 

You might be wondering that there are multiple solutions already available online. So what what makes mine special? 

I will list out the points on what makes my solutions unique :

- All my solutions can be run at DBFIDDLE with POSTGRE SQL V 13 whose link is provided in each case study. So even if you practice on other dialects, you can cross check my solution on dbfiddle and try to apply the same logic in your sql dialect.

- For Case Study 1, I have implemented the solutions to the question in different approaches with full detailed intuition on how to solve the problem with detailed explanations because as a beginner I really want you to understand different ways in which you can solve the same problem.

- For Case Study 2, I've mentioned a note that it is better to solve this case study at the last after completing all the remaining case studies. This is because the level of questions increases dramatically in this case study 2 when compared to previous case study 1 and if you're a beginner, you might really feel discouraged while solving this case study. Hence I advice you to please solve this after finishing all other case studies

- Also for Case Study 2, I've seen multiple resoures which are blantly providing completely wrong solutions or simply ignoring the questions for **Ingredient Optimizaiton, Pricing and Ratings , Bonus Question** sections. In my case study I have provided correct solutions to each and every one of these sections.

- For Case Study 3, I've provided very detailed explanations in multiple approaches for every question. Also for the **10th Question** I've seen people use case statements which hard codes the values and doesn't work when new data is added. So I've provided the generalized query to solve that question which does not use bunch of case statements. And I've also solved **Challenge Payment** Question which many of other resources have skipped.
