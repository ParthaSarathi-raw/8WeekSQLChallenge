# 8-Week SQL Challenge Solutions

In this repository you can find all the Danny's 8 Week Sql Challenge solutions which involves writing SQL queries. 

You might be wondering that there are multiple solutions already available online. So what what makes mine special? 

## What makes my solutions unique :

- All my solutions can be run at DBFIDDLE with POSTGRE SQL V 13 whose link is provided in each case study. So there is no need to import the data and do it somewhere else as inside DBFiddle all the data is already available. DBFiddle works great and I suggest you practice there itself.

- For Case Study 1, I have implemented the solutions to the questions in different approaches with intuition on how to solve the problem and with detailed explanations because as a beginner I really want you to understand different ways in which you can solve the same problem.

- For Case Study 2, I've mentioned a note that it is better to solve this case study at the last after completing all the remaining case studies. This is because the level of questions increases dramatically in this case study 2 when compared to previous case study 1 and if you're a beginner, you might really feel discouraged while solving this case study. Hence I advice you to please solve this after finishing all other case studies

- Also for Case Study 2, I've seen multiple resources which are blantly providing completely wrong solutions or simply ignoring the questions for **Ingredient Optimizaiton, Pricing and Ratings , Bonus Question** sections. In my case study I have provided correct solutions to each and every one of these sections.

- For Case Study 3, I've provided very detailed explanations in multiple approaches for every question. Also for the **10th Question** I've seen people use case statements which hard codes the values and doesn't work when new data is added. So I've provided the generalized query to solve that question which does not use bunch of case statements. And I've also solved **Challenge Payment** Question which many of other resources have skipped.

- For Case Study 4, I've provided detailed explanations, especially for the **4th Question of Customer Nodes Exploration** section, I've provided **correct solution**. But I've seen each and every resource provide **wrong solution** to this question. Hence this really stands out from all other solutions that are available online. Also I've attempted **Data Allocation Challenge** as well for this case study.

- For Case Study 5, I've kept my explanation to minimal, by mininal I don't mean no explanation but just that really short and sweet explanation of how I got the logic etc like that. I'm expecting you to be not a beginner by now which is why I didn't explain each and every small thing. I've also attempted **Before and After Analysis, Bonus Question** for this case study.

- For Case Study 6, I've seen multiple resources where they've skipped **Campaign Analysis** section. I made sure to include those solutions as well in this repository.

- For Case Study 7, I've attempted **Reporting Challenge and Bonus Challenge** sections as well. Also I've kept my explanations to be very minimal from now on since you should be at intermediate level by now. However if you still need further explanations, please reach out to me and I will update my solutions with detailed explanations.

- For Case Study 8, I've provided solutions for all 4 questions in the **Index Analysis** section as well which I've seen everyone usually skip those before while I was solving this case study for the first time myself.

**Suggestion : I would suggest to practice case study 2 after completing all other remaining case studies because of it's difficulty level.**
